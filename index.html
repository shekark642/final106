    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>Hello everyone and welcome to my website! If you are here, it means one of two things. Either one, you are a goal-oriented athlete
        looking to up their game and refine their fitness to become an even better athlete, capable of much greater things. Or two, you 
        aren't an athlete looking to train, however, you know of such people so that after looking through, you can send this website to them.
        Either is completely fine! Take a look through this website and click around on the buttons, but don't forget to learn and have fun! Thanks!
    </p>

    <p>
        I was originally inspired to make this website because I used to be a national-level tennis player. I played across San Diego and 
        California, and traveled far and wide to play tennis. Although after coming to college, my tennis career is somewhat over, I still like
        to play with my friends, and I competitvely play on the UCSD Club Tennis team. I used to be a competitve athlete myself, and everyday used to go 
        towards getting better.
    </p>

    <p>If you are an athlete, this website is perfect for you. Especially for more physically demanding sports, cardiovascular and repiratory fitness
        are two crucial things for performance. They can make or break the sport for you, and we all know how important it is to have a strong Heart
        and lungs. This website is a perfect place to start working on that. With the dataset I used, I have narrowed down and analyzed data from hundreds 
        of people, to create a set of graphs and visualizations to personally help anyone with their journey. As I will explain over the course of this page,
        what I hope you, as a viewer, will do, is try to personalize this website for yourself to create realistic goals for your cardiovascular and respiratory
        health. This website is for you, so explore what other athletes similar to yourself can do!
    </p>


    <h3>introduction</h3>
    <p>
        Here are the basics of what I am about to share with you. The dataset I analyzed consisted of hundreds of professional and amateur athletes,
        all doing a treadmill max performance test. Each participant would go through a warmup period on the treadmill, then slowly ramp up speed. Then after
        they were exhausted, they would slowly lower the speed as a cooldown period. Stats were measured throughout the test, and here is the analysis:
        First, have a slice!

    <p>
        Lets start off with something simple. From what we can see here, we can make a few conclusions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Average trend of speed and heart is to go up and down. This makes sense due to the nature of the treadmill test. 
            People went fast and then slow.</li>
        <li>The average time to tap out was around 800-900 seconds. 15 minutes of high intensity training was enough for these athletes, 
            however, they were still able to do a cooldown, which means they were exhausted but not too exhausted
        </li>
        <li>At the end, things got a little messy. This is a trend we will see a lot, but when you're heart rate is high and blood is pumping,
            people can be very different. As we can see, in the beginning, averages look pretty normal and clustered together, but later on,
            they fluctuate greatly. This is due to each person being different, however the scale of difference between the participants is 
            seen much more towards the end of a run, especially as an older person.
        </li>
      </ul>
      The trends I will point out are common trends, however you may not see them as much depending on the filter you choose to apply
      Feel free to explore many different settings. I am here as an aid, to guide you through what you should be looking for, and what you may find,
      however, you may see different things as you explore different filters.

    <div id="main-content">
        <p>Now let's take a look at a different metric. This graph is about CO2 output and O2 input. The main thing we want to 
            look for here is when the two lines intersect. We start with VO2 being on top and VCO2 being on the bottom. This makes sense as 
            we are normally breathing more oxygen in than exhaling carbon dioxide. As the run progresses, you breathe more oxygen in and produce more carbon dioxide.
            This keeps going and soon you are producing more carbon dioxide than you can breathe in oxygen. This of course slows down after maximal effort.
            
            Comparing this graph about CO2 and O2 to the previous graph, we see some more
            interesting things:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The intersection period is very important, we can see that very shortly after this intersection period, the 
                participant reaches exhaustion and starts cooling down. Producing more CO2 and breathing in O2 is a bad sign.
            </li>
            <li>These two are very related. When one goes down, the other goes down in a very similar fashion, and vice versa.</li>
            <li>VO2 and O2 are very stable metrics. Shortly after the run ends, these levels go back to normal. </li>
          </ul>

        <p>
            Lets look at Pulmonary Ventilation, which is the movement of air into and out of the lungs. This is another standard metric that follows the 
            trend of increasing during the max of the run and then goes down. This is a little bit unique because this metric is very peak oriented.
            VE increases up to a sharp peak and then linearly goes back down to normal levels

        <p>Now Lets take a look at BMI. We will analyze VO2/HR and VCO2/HR data for 4 different participants of each group.
            This metric is important because it shows what a good amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide to have in your system. Of course, it 
            is much healthier to have a lower BMI. There are exceptions like having a lot of muscle mass, which can raise your bmi and incorrectly determine
            you are unhealthy. What can be seen is that the y values for lower bmi athletes are lower. They do not need as much O2 to run, and produce less CO2. 
            These 2 values are more muted as they do not fluctuate in the y direction is much, but the overall y value is very imporant as well.

        <P>
            What I hope to have shown you through this visual experience, is that although everyone is difference, we still have control over 
            our bodies. For athletes, we have the drive to push ourselves towards the finish line of being the most athletic and fit people possible,
            but even for those who aren't, you still have the opportunity to improve your health and fitness. With this huge dataset, I combined facts about fitness
            with real data. Through the personally fitted analysis and trends I provided you today, and I hope to have provided you some kind of goal, whether it be motivation or information to help you train
            better, that you can carry with youself.
