    <h3>Writeup</h3>
    <p>What I have done so far is create a basic template for how I want this site to look.
        I have created the main page and the main visualization in which I want to expand into.
        The main visualization I wan to create for the viewer is based on the pie chart.
        Since right now, I cannot think of a innovative answer for an unknown question so far,
        what I want to do is provide as much analysis on cardiovascular and respitory trends. 
        I have the basic Layout right now of filtering through the dataset to analyze trends, 
        but I want to do this more in depth and for a wider variety of trends.

    </p>


    <p>I think one of the hardest things that I am going to have to overcome is the small
        bugs that I will encounter throughout the process. Right now, one minor bug I am facing is
        that the hover tool does not work on small line plots on the visualization. Right now, if the speed
        data is not alone on the visualization, the hover tool does not work on it. I am also going to have to be 
        creative with the analysis I want to do. Especially working alone, I think the time I will have to spend to
        overcome these minor and potentially major bugs will be a lot. I will also have to spend time to be creative and 
        format my website how I think will best provide insightful analysis to a viewer.
